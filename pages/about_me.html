  <h1>About Me</h1> 
    <p>
      With anything involving my passions or goals, friends and family can all 
      attest that I become completely obsessed with the task at hand. When this happens, making sure
      to complete my task to the highest quality possible becomes my top priority.
      Learning programming stemmed from my love of video games, which began as early as four.
      When a friend of mine wanted to create a video game with me, with him handling the art and I the programming, my coding journey officially begun!
      Since then, I continue to dedicate hours to programming daily to hone my skills, learn new ones, and improve my craft as a whole.
